# Crazy Fibonacci

My implementation of Binet's formula and fast doubling method for computation of the nth Fibonacci number in Python, using the decimal library.

Any nth Fibonacci number, with n from 0 to 4784971966781665971, could be computed in a fraction of a second!

*Note: From n = 123, there is some loss of accuracy.*
